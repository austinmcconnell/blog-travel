Howdy! My name is Austin McConnell. I caught the travel bug way back in college. Looking for a way to travel for less, I stumbled upon guides to earning credit card points and redeeming them for airfare and hotels. From there, I started my points-collecting journey.
 
Fast forward a couple years, I got married to my beautiful wife, Katie, and we went to Europe for a three week honeymoon (much of which was paid for with points). A couple years later we went back to Europe for another 3 week adventure.

Soon after, we started having kids so traveling took a backseat for a while. Scratch that, the backseat was filled up with carseats so travelling was kicked to the curb.

As more years have passed, I've realized I don't want to wait another decade to start traveling again in earnest. There must be family-friendly ways to travel with kids. Through this blog, I'll share what I discover in the hope that it can help others as well.
