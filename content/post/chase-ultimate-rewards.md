Rather than try to earn points in scattered loyalty programs across airlines and hotels, it's best to choose a single program and focus your efforts there. Focus your efforts and pool points in a single place and then transfer to hotels or airlines programs as and when needed.

Yes. As you level up your points game, there will come a time when it makes sense to start earning points in multiple programs. But to begin, I strongly recommend focusing on a single points program. The best single program to earn points that I've found is Chase Ultimate Rewards.

### Chase Ultimate Rewards

Chase Ultimate Rewards points are a highly valuable points that can be redeemed for travel in a couple key ways.

##### Ultimate Rewards Portal

Chase has a great portal where you can book airfare using your Ultimate Rewards points.

If you are looking at a flight that costs $350, you could book that flight through the Chase travel portal for either 28,000 points (if you have the Chase Sapphire Preferred credit card) or 23,333 points (if you have the Chase Sapphire Reserve credit card).


##### Transfer Partners

To get even more value for you points, you can transfer your points to any of Chase's [13 transfer partners]({{ < ref "chase-transfer-partners.md" > }}) (10 airline partners and 3 hotel partners). Once your points are in the airline or hotel loyalty program, you can often get **3 - 5 cents value per point**.

These Hotel and airline point redemptions can be far more lucrative deals than redeeming through the rewards portal directly. You might wonder, why not just earn those points directly in the airline or hotel programs themselves? If you know you need to stay with hotel X or use airline Y for an upcomming trip, then sure you can focus your efforts on earning points directly with that brand.

My general strategy focuses on collecting highly valuable points while preserving flexibility and choice in where to redeem those points.
