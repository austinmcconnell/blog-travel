## Keep or Cancel?

I plan on keeping this card in my wallet long term because Hyatt has two kid-friendly resorts near Austin, TX (Lost Pines in Bastrop, TX and Hill Country in San Antonio, TX). We plan to rotating summer weekend vacations at these two resorts and using our free anniversary night to keep the cost down.
