Chase Freedom is my card for getting 5x points on up to $1,500 spend in rotating quarterly categories.

It's also one of the three cards in my [Chase Trifecta]({{< ref "the-chase-trifecta.md" >}} "Chase Trifecta").

Issuer: Chase
Annual Fee: $0

## Card Benefits

- 5x points on up to $1,500 spend in rotating quarterly categories
- 5x points on travel purchased through the Chase Travel Portal

## Keep or Cancel?

I will keep this card so I can get the high 5x points when the rotating categories match what I would normally spend in a given month. Also, the annual fee is $0 so there is no real reason to not keep this card open.
