The foundation of my points earning strategy consists of three cards from chase. These cards allow me to earn between 1.5 and 5 points per dollar spent which translates into 3% to 15% of travel value per dollar spent.

### The Chase Trifecta 

##### Chase Sapphire Preferred

The Chase Sapphire Preferred is my anchor card around which my foundational strategy is built. Using this card will earn 3x points per dollar spent dining and 2x points per dollar spent on travel. It unlocks [Ultimate Rewards]({{< ref "chase-ultimate-rewards.md" >}}), ...
It has an annual fee of $95, but I believe it's worth keeping in my wallet long term because...

##### Chase Freedom Unlimited

The Chase Freedom Unlimited in my default card. This card earns 1.5 points per dollar spent and has no annual fee.
 
Unless I have a reason to put spend on a different card (e.g. 5x for a bonus category or 3x on dining), I'll spend on this card to earn 1.5 points per dollar.

##### Chase Freedom

I use the Chase Freedom card to earn 5x points on up to $1500 spend in rotating bonus categories each quarter. The bonus must be activated each quarter. 

### Example

Okay, let's break this down into some numbers.

##### 5x Rotating Categories 

First, let's consider the bonus category which earns us 5x points per dollar up to $1,500.

I'll attempt to max the 5x bonus spend each quarter which requires $1500 in spending over 3 months (avg $500 per month). Based on each quarter's bonus categories, sometimes this will be easier than others.

If I can max out the bonus spend in a given quarter, I'll have spent $1500 and I'll get 7,500 points (1500 x 5). If I can max the bonus spend for each quarter, at the end of the year I'll have spent $6,000 and will have earned **30,000 points**. 

##### 3x Dining and 2x Travel

I'll keep this part fairly simple. I know many families will spend way more than this on dining and travel, but we don't personally eat out all that much or travel (without using points) all that often. We are cost-conscious and really want to get good value out of our spent dollars. All that to say, I'm going to assume $125 spent per month on average. Feel free to adjust your number higher or lower.

$100 / month x 12 months = $1,200 annual spend on dining. At the end of the year, I will have earned **3600 points** from dining purchases.

Let's say $500 annual spend on travel. At the end of the year, I will have earned **1000 points** from travel related purchases.

##### All other spend

Let's just keep it easy and assume $1000 average spend per month for all other spending (not bonus category, dining, or travel related). That's $12,000 per year which (at 1.5 points per dollar) is **18,000 points**.

##### Summary

So across the 3 cards, I can hopefully accumulate **51,000 points** each year by spending only as much as I normally would and putting that spend on specific credit cards. The hardest part will be maximizing the quarterly bonus spend categories, but there are some tips & tricks that can make that a lot more achievable.
