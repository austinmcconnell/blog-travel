Chase Freedom Unlimited is my default card for purchases due to the 1.5 points per dollar spent. 

It's also one of the three cards in my [Chase Trifecta]({{< ref "the-chase-trifecta.md" >}} "Chase Trifecta").

Issuer: Chase
Annual Fee: $0

Note: I product changed my original Chase Sapphire Preferred from 2013 to the Chase Freedom Unlimited to remove the annual fee.

## Card Benefits

- 3x points on dining
- 3x points on Drugstores
- 1.5x points on all other purchases
- 5x points on travel purchased through the Chase Travel Portal

## Keep or Cancel?

I will keep this card so I can earn 1.5 points on every dollar spent that doesn't have a better multiplier elsewhere. Also, the annual fee is $0 so there is no real reason to not keep this card open.
