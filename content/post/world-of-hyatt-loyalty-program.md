Standard award redemptions start at 5,000 points for a Category 1 hotel and go up to 40,000 points for a Category 8 hotel. Compared to other hotel brands, you can get incredibly good deals on rooms with Hyatt points.

Hyatt points are generally valued at about 2.0 cents per point.

I can transfer Chase Ultimate Rewards points to Hyatt at a 1:1 ratio.

Hyatt is one of only two main hotel chains (the other is Marriott) that let you use suite upgrades to guarantee a suite (which is huge when travelling with kiddos)

Hyatt Status is considered one of the most valuable elite statuses. If you can get to Globalist status, you get some sweet perks like:
- Free breakfast for up to 2 adults and 2 children per room
- Free parking on award nights
- Resort fees waived on award nights
- Room upgrades (including suites)
- Guest of Honor (share Globalist status with others)
