Chase Freedom Flex is a duplicate card for getting 5x points on up to $1,500 spend in rotating quarterly categories.

It's a duplicate of one of the cards in my [Chase Trifecta]({{< ref "the-chase-trifecta.md" >}} "Chase Trifecta").

Issuer: Chase
Annual Fee: $0

## Card Benefits

- 5x points on up to $1,500 spend in rotating quarterly categories
- 5x points on travel purchased through the Chase Travel Portal
- 3x points on dining
- 3x points on drugstores

## Keep or Cancel?

I will keep this second card so I can get double dip the the 5x points when the rotating categories match what I would normally spend in a given month. Also, the annual fee is $0 so there is no real reason to not keep this card open.
